## Introduction and Background
Polypharmacy and drug interaction issues are becoming more common during medication. Polypharmacy is also on the rise among the elderly. Warfarin, which is used in patients with cardiovascular disease, can interact with certain medications, causing side effects ranging from easy bleeding to internal bleeding. Good drug management, such as a list of current drugs consumed, a drug interaction knowledge library, and so on, may help to resolve this issue. However, current health and drug management applications are unable to provide drug interaction warnings. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a web application to collect medication data in order to analyze Warfarin drug interactions .
